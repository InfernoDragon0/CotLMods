# Previous Lore Entries
### Season 1 Lore
Brief, Episode 3: The followers have continued their research into the Strange Material, it seems to be some form of circuit that can react and turned into energy using gold and other methods. The lamb decides to take advantage of this Strange Material and came up with several different types of exotic machines to be built. It can also be used to perform rituals, infusing the material into followers. Would there be consequences?

Brief, Episode 2: After several months of extraction and research, the followers have found that the strange materials are appearing more often. It seems that the strange material reacts strongly to gold, and sometimes followers as well. The Lamb wishes to use this material to improve the Cult. But what could the strange material be?

Brief, Episode 1: The Lamb has found a strange sphere that seems to have fallen from the sky, could it be a meteorite? The followers have been tasked to study and extract the materials from it, to see if there is anything useful that can be salvaged. The Lamb then provides a few tools for research, such as a study table to read up on known materials, and a telescope to look out for other suspicious sky activities.
