## Chef & Food Storage
- This mod adds in the Chef role for followers, as well as Food Storage I and II. Only food storage I is tested and works with the Chef and Kitchen
- Assign a Chef by talking to a follower > work > chef
- You need to upgrade the Cooking Fire to a Kitchen for the chef to be able to start cooking
- Select food in the cooking menu, then leave and the Chef will cook it automatically (takes awhile depending on food type)
- Food Storage and Kitchen have blank icons

## Chef Logic
Chef Role's logic has been slightly modified from vanilla with the following changes
- The Prayer devotion bar is used as an indicator that flashes when the chef finishes cooking
- The Chef will have a reaction on finish cooking
- The Chef will not leave the kitchen after completing all the orders (sometimes might still leave due to bugs idk)


## Additional stuff
- Shrine stores 2000 Souls max instead
- Clicking the Shrine once will grab all the souls instead of just 1
- Skips Intro Cutscene
- Kitchen II seems to be incomplete in the vanilla code, so not tested
- Food Storage II not tested

## Requirements
- BepInEx Pack
- COTL API
