### Trials
Note that all of them can be active at the same time
- **Trial of Narinder**: Each active Augment will increase your dodge cooldown by 25%, Each active Trial will grant enemies a 10% chance of instantly killing you on hit, and increases your vulnerability to damage by 1% for each enemy you have killed during the run.
- **Trial of Leshy**: For each active Augment, whenever an enemy takes non lethal damage, there is a 5% chance for them to duplicate. For each active Trial, a copy of each non-boss enemy will spawn every 10 seconds.
- **Trial of Heket**: For each active Trial, whenever you take damage, you have a 10% chance of losing a tarot card, if you have no tarot cards, you lose 1 max HP. For each active Augment, each time you take damage, you lose 10% of curse charge.
- **Trial of Shamura**: For each active Trial, each time you take damage, all enemies heals 10% health. For each active Augment, when enemies take damage, their damage resistance increases by 0.5%.
- **Trial of Kallamar**: For each active Trial, this effect speeds up by 1 second. Every 6 seconds, all enemies drop a pool of poison. For each active Augment, this effect speeds up by 1 second. Every 11 seconds, a pool of poison is spawned on your location.

- Augment of Grace: When an enemy dies, all other enemies heal 25% of their Max hp

### Beta Notes
- It is intended to be nearly impossible to survive a run with all trials and augments enabled, without the help of supercharged tarots. However, crashing and major lag spikes is not intended, so let me know if any trial or augment interactions will create massive lag spikes.
- The building for Trials of the Gods is reusing the Relic Generator structure, if you had that, you can apply the augments from there
- The trials and augments apply to normal runs
- Any trigger of trials or augments is recorded in the debug log
- trials difficulty increase per trial and augment applied at the same time.
- There may or may not be additional content for this in the future, you may suggest add ons or feedback on the existing augments and trials too
